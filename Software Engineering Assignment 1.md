# Introduction and Motivation: 
This Research Totally relays on the De-budding factors, as the Decades ago, many Researchers have worked and sorted out something for De bug the Programming Code easily So that the Programmer can work smoothly with the project. As per this Research, the Motivation comes from the projects end that any programmer can work smoothly with the number of lines of code and the project will give a special assistance to sort out with De-bug from a lines of Code and come up with the suggestion for a new line or a keywork which can proceed to the whole program. When the bug is fixed, then the project is ready to use. Debugging tools (Debugging Input) is used to identify coding errors at various development stages. They are used to reproduce the conditions in which error has occurred, then examine the program state at that time and locate the cause of error.

# Research and Methodology: 
Research and Methodology is based on the Various groups in which some are working Extremely for Dubbing Factors some of them are for alignment and grammatical error  etc. the Whole research was relaying on ddmax as this research aims to maximize the debug inputs and rephrase with a new code or key word.  Ddmax actually refers to delta debugging max. Which provides an assistance to get involve with the line of code entering from the programmer’s end. 
# Result: 
The given result is showing the outcomes what user’s input is and how project helps to find debugging factor from that input in a run time.
